We do not have to use express but its much easier to use it, allows us to write clean code

If we want to listen for get request. First argument is the path we want to listen to.
The second is a function that takes req and res. Req gives us info about type or request, url.
Res sends a response
app.get('/')
res.send() is equall to  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
express will figure out for us the type of content and status code
