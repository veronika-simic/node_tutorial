Middleware is any kind of code which runs on the server between getting a request and seding a response
use method is used to run some Middleware code, we can have many functions like this
.get handlers are also Middleware but difference between get and use is that get runs only for get request
while use runs for each request

Middleware runs top to bottom, order is very important
With Middleware we can log details of every request, authenticate users, return 404
