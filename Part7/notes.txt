View engines

They allow us to write html and inject dynamic data and logic into them (variables, loops)

<% const name = "vera" %> 

When displaying data we need equall sing
<p><%= name %></p>


We can pass data to this files 
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index", {title: 'Home'}); // we need to tell express where this path is relative from so we pass an object, what is this path relative to
});

this way property title is beeing passed to ejs. In order to use it we use pipes
<title><Blog Ninja | <%title %></title>
