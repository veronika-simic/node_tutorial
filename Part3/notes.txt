Clients and servers

We type the website address which sends request to server. Server then looks into the request and decides what it is going to respond. 
How does a browser know to which server its going to send the request? 
IP address (instead we use Domain names). Clients and servers communicate with HTTP
In node we manually create server unlike PHP
