Clients and servers

We type the website address which sends request to server. Server then looks into the request and decides what it is going to respond. 
How does a browser know to which server its going to send the request? 
IP address (instead we use Domain names). Clients and servers communicate with HTTP
In node we manually create server unlike PHP 

What is localhost? 
It is like a domain name
It takes us into loop address. It takes us back to our own computer. It means listen for events coming to our own computer
We need a port number because its like doors into computers. They must be different from other apps like skype or spotify so they do not clash.
